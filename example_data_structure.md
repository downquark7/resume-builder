```

### 2. Use Action Verbs
- Led, Developed, Implemented, Optimized, Created, Designed
- Collaborated, Mentored, Managed, Analyzed, Improved

### 3. Include Relevant Keywords
- Match terminology from job descriptions
- Use industry-standard terms
- Include specific technologies and tools

### 4. Keep It Current
- Update regularly with new experiences
- Remove outdated information
- Focus on recent and relevant achievements

### 5. Be Consistent
